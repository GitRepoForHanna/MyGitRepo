This is the song
sword and spear 
wall of shields

Form the lines
Shiels by shield

This is the song
sword and spear 
wall of shields

---------------------------


Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny


There are new fields
In the world
And the sky is blue
And the wind is strong

This is the song
sword and spear 
wall of shields
The birds are singing 
And the Sun is shining
